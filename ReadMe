To create a Reactjs app for helpdesk ticket management, you will need to follow these steps:

Create a new Reactjs project using create-react-app command.
Set up routing for your app using react-router library.
Create components for the different views in your app such as a list view for displaying all tickets, a detail view for displaying a single ticket, and a form view for creating new tickets.
Use a state management library such as Redux to manage the state of your application.
Use axios or fetch to make API calls to a backend server that will handle the creation, reading, updating, and deleting of tickets.
Style your app using CSS or a CSS-in-JS library such as styled-components.
It's a good idea to use a library for the UI design like "Material-UI" or "Ant Design" to make the design process easy.

I recommend you to start by building a simple version of the app and then iterate on it, adding more features and functionalities as you go.

you can now add more functionality and features like adding new tickets, viewing a single ticket, and updating or deleting existing tickets.

npm install react-router-dom
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install axios
json-server --watch db.json
